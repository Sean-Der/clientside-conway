Conway's game of life implemented in Javascript

Implemented without any external libraries, and makes use of WebWorkers and the canvas element.

It currently uses the following simple algorithim of checking only alive cells and their neighbors,
but I am going to start looking at how other people solved the problem.

My goal was to write it without any outside influence on my first try, so there will defiantly be optimizations to be made
